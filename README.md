# 🌌 WELCOME TO THE NUMBERVERSE

## 🏛️ A Realm of Logic, Intuition, and Wit
The Numberverse is a sophisticated terminal-based experience where numbers are living entities and logic is your only weapon. Developed in the mystical peaks of Shimla, this project transforms a classic guessing mechanic into a high-stakes psychological battle between you and a witty, occasionally sarcastic AI.

This isn't just a game; it is a quest to become a "Number Whisperer". You will face progressively challenging trials designed to sharpen your senses and elevate you from a novice to a legend.
Endless Progression: With no level cap, the challenge grows as long as you can keep guessing correctly.
Dynamic AI Mentor: The game features hundreds of unique comments where the AI reacts to your score, milestones, and even your failures.
Smart Scoring: Earn +10 points for every correct guess while navigating penalties that vary by difficulty.
