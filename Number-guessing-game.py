### Welcome to The Numberverse, Apprentice!

**Last Updated:** July 25, 2025

Greetings from the mystical peaks of Shimla! You have been chosen to enter the Numberverse, a realm where logic, intuition, and a bit of luck intertwine. Here, numbers are not just symbols; \nthey are living entities, and only those with a keen mind can decipher their secrets.\n

As an apprentice, your journey is to master the art of "Number Whispering." You will face progressively challenging trials, each designed to sharpen your senses and elevate you from a novice to a legend. \nYour guide, a witty and occasionally sarcastic AI, will accompany you, offering "encouragement" and tracking your progress. \nDo you have what it takes to achieve a perfect score and become the ultimate Number Master?

    ### **How to Play: The Rules of the Numberverse**

    Your quest is to guess a secret number within a given range. With each correct guess, you advance to a new level, where the challenge grows, but so do the rewards.

    1.  **Objective:** Guess the secret number in each level to increase your score and advance. The game ends when you run out of chances.
    2.  **Scoring:**
        * Each correct guess earns you **+10 points**.
        * Each incorrect guess deducts points based on the difficulty level. Your score will never drop below zero.
    3.  **Hints:** After every incorrect guess, the AI will provide a hint, telling you if your guess was **too high, high, a bit high, too low, low,** or **a bit low**. Use these clues to narrow down your next guess.
    4.  **High Score:** The game tracks your highest score across all playthroughs in your current session. Aim to beat your own record!
